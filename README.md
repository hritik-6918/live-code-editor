Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When you open the project, you can see the editor page on your browser where you can type code on one side of the page. Also, see its results on another side. On the result side, we can only see the content that we write inside the body tag. While the codes inside other tags are not seen but it helps in making some changes to the body content.
